                        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
                        <p>I am interested in digital and emerging media, especially how new technologies shape communication and social behavior. My focus includes emerging technologies and computer-assisted communication, such as how algorithms, platforms, and AI affect who speaks, who is heard, and how communities form online. I am also drawn to studying how visual and interactive media influence public opinion and cultural expression across different groups and contexts.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in theories that explain how people interact through technology, such as social information processing, affordances, and media effects. I want to apply these theories to understand why certain platform designs shape user behavior, trust, and community norms. Linking theory to data helps me form testable hypotheses and design effective interventions.</p>
                        <p>I apply research findings to design interventions and prototypes. This can involve creating wireframes, low-fidelity prototypes, or feature concepts that address user needs identified in research. I also run basic usability tests and gather feedback to iterate on designs that are practical and user-friendly.</p>

                        <h2>Research Skills</h2>
                        <p>I use quantitative research methods and computational approaches to study media and communication. I am experienced with survey design, content analysis, and crosstab and statistical analysis. I also apply computational tools—such as scripting for data collection, basic data cleaning, and exploratory analysis—to handle large datasets from social platforms. In addition, I can conduct user interviews and develop persona-based scenarios to combine qualitative insights with quantitative findings, helping translate results into clear design and policy recommendations.</p>
                        <p>My approach combines careful study design with practical data work. I start by defining clear research questions, then choose methods that match those questions—surveys and experiments for causal claims, content analysis for patterns in media, and interviews for deeper user perspectives. I prioritize reproducible workflows and transparent reporting.</p>
                        <p>I work with quantitative tools to measure and model communication behavior. This includes survey analysis, inferential statistics, crosstabulation, regression, and basic time-series or frequency analysis. I emphasize good measurement practices (validity, reliability) and clear presentation of results using tables and graphs that follow academic standards.</p>
